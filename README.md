Personal website

This is a personal webiste. I designed it as a way to show my skills to potential employers and to play around and learn about different things related to web dev.

This website, due to the nature of the project, is always going to be a work-in-progress as I learn about new features and get better at web development.
You can check out what I will try to implement or work on next by going to the issues tab of the repository.
