            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="light-gray-text">I am a fifth year Computer Science undergraduate student at
            <a class="links" href="https://www.mtu.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan Technological University</a>, expecting to 
            graduate Spring 2024.
            </p>

            <p class="light-gray-text">I decided to become a Computer Science major because I took Python and Java programming
            classes in high school and I loved them. I love problem-solving, I love math, and I love working with computers,
            so it was a perfect fit.</p>

            <p class="light-gray-text">Although I may have a technical side, I have been drawing, designing, and writing stories
            ever since I was little. I am also very people-focused and hope to add a people focus to my work in development.
            I decided UI/UX design and development would combine the creative and technical aspects of my personality,
            as well as allow me to help others by making easy-to-use UIs, so I aspire to be a UI/UX Designer and Developer.</p>

            <p class="light-gray-text">In general, I am a very visual person and love working with visuals in multiple different
            mediums. Growing up, I mainly worked with paper and pencil drawings, but my interests in visuals have shifted to 
            include other mediums as well. I enjoy making digital art and graphics with Adobe Illustrator and the app ArtFlow.
            I am trying to learn animation with Adobe Animate, and would like to learn 3D animation using Blender as well. I also 
            enjoy embroidery, and I am learning how to sew so that one day, I can design and create my own clothes.</p>

            <h5 class="gray-text bold">Experience</h5>
            <p class="light-gray-text">I have group project experience in website design and development. In high school, I was on
            <a class="links" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FIRST</a> Robotics Competition
            <a class="links" href="https://frogforce503.org/index.html" target="_blank">Team 503</a>
            and I started learning about how to make web pages so I could help develop the scouting web application.
            In college, I joined the Chem Store project in the
            <a class="links" href="http://hide.cs.mtu.edu/" target="_blank">Humane Interface Design Enterprise (HIDE)</a>
            in 2022 and was working on front-end development. In addition, my group in my Team Software Project class decided
            to make a website called Schedule Helper to make selecting classes easier and I was working on UI/UX and the front-end
            for the project. In Spring 2024, I came back to HIDE, but this time on the Human Factors team. This time, I wanted to refine
        my  UI design skills and learn how to use tools such as Figma, while learning and applying concepts like the Gestalt Principles.</p>

            <p class="light-gray-text">In addition to group project experience, I also have work experience in this field.
            In Summer 2022, I worked as an intern at
            <a class="links" href="https://www.lear.com/" target="_blank">Lear Corporation</a>.
            My role was to develop an application for the company's plants. The application
            was made using
            <a class="links" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-6.0" target="_blank">.NET 6 Blazor</a>
            and used the
            <a class="links" href="https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui" target="_blank">Telerik UI for Blazor</a>
            component library. At my internship, I designed light and dark themes for the application and
            implemented a toggle that allowed you to switch between color themes of the site.</p>

            <h5 class="gray-text bold">Career Goals</h5>
            <p class="light-gray-text">Over the course of my career, I have many goals. They are all related to working on many 
            aspects of UIs for apps and webpages. On the human-centered side, I would like to research user needs to make sure that the UI is 
            exactly what the user needs it to be. I would like to conduct usability testing to make sure that the design is exactly what
            the user needs and expects it to be. On the design side, I would like to wireframe and design the look and feel of the UI,
            as well as create any needed assets for the UI in Adobe Illustrator. Finally, on the coding side, I would like to work with
            JavaScript to manipulate CSS. I really enjoyed using JavaScript and CSS when creating the dark/light mode toggle at my 
            internship at Lear, and would like to continue working with code of that sort. I would also like to learn how to make animated 
            web pages. It gives websites a touch of interactivity, which contributes to the user's experience on the site.
